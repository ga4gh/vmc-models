/**
   Represents the definite (not fuzzy) location of a sequence
   feature using interbase coordinates.

   Interbase coordinates refer to the points between residues.  For a
   sequence of length n, 0 ≤ start ≤ end ≤ n, where 0 refers to the
   point before the start of the sequence, n refers to the point at
   the end of the sequence.  An interval in which start == end is a
   zero width point between two nucleotides.  See
   http://gmod.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Chado#Interbase_Coordinates
   for more information.
